# Embedded Linux Project

Welcome to the Embedded Linux repository! This project is focused on building and understanding a complete Embedded Linux system for ARM architecture. Embedded Linux is a specialized version of the Linux operating system tailored for embedded devices, offering flexibility, scalability, and extensive support for hardware and software.

## What is Embedded Linux?

Embedded Linux is a lightweight operating system designed to run on embedded systems such as IoT devices, routers, automotive systems, and industrial control units. It provides:

- **Customizability**: Ability to include or exclude specific features.
- **Low Resource Usage**: Optimized for systems with limited CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Hardware Support**: Extensive support for a wide range of processors and peripherals.
- **Open Source**: Leveraging the Linux kernel and open-source tools to build robust solutions.

## Project Progress

The project is structured into multiple phases, each focusing on a critical component of an Embedded Linux system. Below is the current progress:

### âœ… Toolchain
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Built a cross-compilation toolchain using crosstool-NG for ARM architecture. This toolchain is critical for compiling applications and system components for the target hardware.

### ðŸš§ Kernel
- **Status**: Under Construction
- **Description**: The Linux kernel is being configured and compiled to support the target ARM architecture.

### ðŸš§ Bootloader
- **Status**: Under Construction
- **Description**: Work is underway to select and configure a bootloader (e.g., U-Boot) that will initialize the hardware and load the kernel.

### ðŸš§ Root Filesystem
- **Status**: Under Construction
- **Description**: The root filesystem will include essential binaries, libraries, and configuration files to run the system.

### ðŸš§ Testing and Integration
- **Status**: Planned
- **Description**: The final step involves integrating all components and testing the complete system using QEMU or actual hardware.

## What's Next?

1. Complete kernel configuration and compilation.
2. Set up the bootloader.
3. Build the root filesystem.
4. Integrate all components and test on QEMU or hardware.
